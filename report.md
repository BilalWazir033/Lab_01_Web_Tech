# Lab 01 Reflection
During this lab, I learned how to create and manage files using Git and GitHub. 
I practiced adding, committing, and pushing files to a repository, which helped me understand how version control works. 
I also learned how to create and switch branches, and how changes can be managed separately in different branches. 
Working with .gitignore and tracking file deletions gave me a clearer understanding of how Git monitors project files. 
Overall, this lab improved my confidence in using Git for project management.
